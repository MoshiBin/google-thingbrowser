<h1>Clink<br/><br/><img src="clinkLogo.png"></h1>

<!-- ############################################################### -->

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Develop a next-generation Internet application component model.</p>

<!-- ############################################################### -->

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Clink is a generalization of the Thing Browser idea. While the
Thing Browser specifically involved using a Java runtime in a Web
browser, Clink provides an API allowing multiple languages to
interoperate.</p>

<!-- ############################################################### -->

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Clink is a plug-in that extends a browser to resolve URLs to active
objects. These objects are implemented on the client machine, and may
be self-contained or may be local stubs to remote services. The
objects have a default user interface, allowing them to be either
directly displayed by following a link or bookmark, or embedded in a
Web page or the user interface of an enclosing object.</p>

<p>Our proposal is to build an extension into one or more common Web
browsers (initially Firefox). This extension will allow code in
multiple implementation languages (C++, Java, JavaScript) to be
dynamically loaded and run without restarting the browser. In our
system, a plug-in defines a set of destinations that are identifiable
by URIs, for example:</p>

<blockquote><nobr>
<code>http://mail.google.com/messages/fac3421a4cc123ff</code><br/>
<code>http://mail.google.com/Inbox</code><br/>
<code>http://mail.google.com/labels/from-joe</code>
</nobr></blockquote>

<p>Each of these destinations behaves like a "Web page": it responds
predictably to the <em>Back</em> and <em>Forward</em> buttons; it may
be bookmarked; etc. Similarly to the Web, the URI of each destination
is the address of a piece of <em>data</em> provided by the hosting
plug-in, rather than to an application environment. Pictorially, our
architecture is as follows:</p>

<center><img src="clinkHighLevelArch.png"/></center>

<p>Note the following points:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The plug-ins can interoperate within the Clink runtime without
regard to their language of implementation. We will discuss how we do
this below.</p></li>

<li><p>Some plug-ins live in a security sandbox that is global to the
entire plug-in. This is appropriate for programming languages like
Java which allow mutable static state, such that, from a security
perspective, an entire codebase must be considered as a unit.</p></li>

<li><p>Some plug-ins are implemented such that each individual
<em>object</em> can be sandboxed independently.  This may be possible
with special dialects or usages of common languages, or with a
completely new language. The benefit is that security for these
plug-ins can be implemented using <em>object capabilities</em> and can
therefore be made more fine-grained and usable.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

<h3>URL resolution</h3>

<p>When the user types in a link like:</p>

<blockquote><code>http://mail.google.com/inbox</code></blockquote>

<p>Clink intercepts this request and allows an installed plug-in to
serve the result of this content. If no plug-in is willing to serve
this URL, Clink allows the browser to fetch the contents normally
using HTTP.</p>

<p>Clink exposes this functionality to plug-ins running within the
browser as well. A plug-in resolves a URL via the Clink APIs for its
implementation language (we'll use JavaScript in our examples). The
result of resolving a URL is a Thing object:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
var aThing = Clink.resolveUrl("http://mail.google.com/inbox");
</pre>

<p>A Thing represents some semantic unit of information (an email
inbox, a mail message, a calendar entry) identified by the supplied
URL. A multi-valued information source, such as an RSS feed or a set
of search results, is represented by a Thing that has collection or
iterator semantics.</p>

<h3>User interface</h3>

<p>A Thing must be able to return a DOM node representing
itself visually:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
var aDomNode = aThing.getViewNode();
document.getElementById("viewContainer").addChild(aDomNode);
</pre>

<p>In fact, the behavior of Clink when the user enters the URL of a
Thing in the browser's location bar (or navigates by following a link
or bookmark) is to simply wrap the <code>viewNode</code> of the
resulting Thing in a minimal HTML DOM and display it in the current
browser window.  If the visual representation of a Thing requires
native widgets, the Thing is responsible for enclosing these in a
suitable DOM node.</p>

<h3>Programmatic interface</h3>

<p>The interface of a Thing is very simple, similar to the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUnknown"><code>IUnknown</code></a>
interface familiar to Microsoft COM programmers. Richer interaction
with a Thing is granted by its Facets:</p>

<center><img src="facetsOfThings.png"/></center>

<p>In the above example, both Things support the
<code>MimeResource</code> Facet (or interface), allowing them to be
viewed as a source of MIME information. Only one of the Things
supports the <code>MailMessage</code> Facet, making it understandable
to an email application. The code in the email application would look
like the following:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
var thingUrl = "http://mail.google.com/msg/24ad4c30";
var facetUrl = "http://mail.acme.com/MailInterfaces-2.4.12.flute#MailMessage";

var aThing = Clink.resolveUrl(thingUrl);

if (aThing != undefined) {

  // A non-null value means that the URL refers to *some* valid
  // Thing. But the reference 'aThing' provides little or no
  // information. We need to ask it for a specific Facet (or
  // interface) before we can have a meaningful conversation
  // with it.

  var mailMessageFacet = aThing.getFacet(facetUrl);

  if (mailMessageFacet != undefined) {

    // A non-null value means that aThing supports the requested
    // Facet *and* that we are allowed access to that Facet based
    // on the prevailing security restrictions. We can now use that
    // Facet to get some information.

    alert("The sender is: " + mailMessageFacet.sender);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that an instance of a Facet of a Thing is, in the security
sense, equivalent to a capability on that Thing. We will discuss
further the security implications of Facet negotiation later on in
this document.</p>

<h3>Flute interface definition language</h3>

<p>The interface of a Facet is described in an XML language called
Flute, which is very similar in style to <a
href="http://relaxng.org/">Relax NG</a>. A Flute interface is
identified by a stable URL that acts as a globally unique
identifier. Any change to the syntax or semantics of an interface
requires that its URL be modified. The following is a Flute document
describing the Facets of an email application:</p>

<pre name="code" class="xml:nocontrols">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE flute [
  &lt;!ENTITY baseUrl "http://mail.acme.com/MailInterfaces-2.4.12.flute"&gt;
]&gt;

&lt;flute
    baseUrl="http://mail.acme.com/MailInterfaces-2.4.12.flute"
    xmlns="http://schemas.flute.org/flute/1.0"&gt;

  &lt;interface xml:id="MailMessage"&gt;
    &lt;property
        name="messageId"
        type="string"
        access="readonly"/&gt;
    &lt;property
        name="sender"
        type="&baseUrl;#EmailAddress"
        access="readonly"/&gt;
    &lt;property
        name="recipients"
        type="&baseUrl;#EmailAddress"
        access="readonly"
        cardinality="0..*"
        ordered="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/interface&gt;

  &lt;interface xml:id="EmailAddress"&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/interface&gt;

  &lt;interface xml:id="Mailbox"&gt;
    &lt;operation name="sendMessage"&gt;
      &lt;parameter name="message" type="&baseUrl;#MailMessage"/&gt;
      &lt;parameter name="immediate" type="boolean"/&gt;
    &lt;/operation&gt;
    &lt;property
        name="size"
        type="integer"
        access="readonly"/&gt;
    &lt;operation name="getItem"&gt;
      &lt;parameter name="index" type="integer"/&gt;
      &lt;return type="thing"/&gt;
    &lt;/operation&gt;
  &lt;/interface&gt;

&lt;/flute&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>TODO(ihab):</strong> Should Relax NG schemata be available
as a source of <code>struct</code>-like definitions for use in Flute
interfaces? Would that be useful, and how would it work?</p>

<h3>Implementation languages</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, Clink can host Things in multiple languages,
such as JavaScript, Java, C and C++. For each hosted language, Clink
exposes APIs appropriate to the style of the language. These APIs
allow code to register different kinds of Things, register different
views on Things, take control of subsets of the URL space, and
otherwise perform whatever management tasks are appropriate and
natural for programmers in that language.

<center><img src="clinkLayers.png"/></center>

<h3>Flute interface repository</h3>

<p>The Clink runtime requires some functionality to map abstract Flute
URLs to Flute interface definitions. This allows us to decide on a
case by case basis whether a given Flute file must be directly
acessible via HTTP at the URL that identifies it or, as with XML
namespaces, simply available in some well-known location.</p>

<p>This functionality is the Flute interface repository. From any
implementation language, it will be possible to retrieve the
definitions corresponding to a given URL as an XML DOM.</p>

<h3>JavaScript interface</h3>

<p>A programmer writing in JavaScript can implement interface
<code>...#MailMessage</code> by passing in an object having the
desired bindings. In such a dynamic language, the Flute definition of
the interface serves more as documentation than anything else:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
var aThing = /* some object */;
var aSender = /* some object */;
var mailMessageFacet = new Object() {
  messageId : "<1175383505.m2f.104175@forums.matronics.com>",
  sender : aSender,
};

Clink.registerFacet(
    aThing,
    "http://mail.acme.com/MailInterfaces-2.4.12.flute#MailMessage",
    mailMessageFacet);
</pre>

<h3>Java interface</h3>

<p>To make a Java class implement a Facet, we use annotations. This
has the advantage of being implementable using either compile-time or
run-time code generation, or simple manual annotation of POJOs by the
programmer. The Clink runtime can detect when an incorrect or
incomplete implementation is returned as an implementation of a Facet.</p>

<p>An example of the implementation of the
<code>...#MailMessage</code> interface would be:</p>

<pre name="code" class="java:nocontrols">
@FluteInterface("http://mail.acme.com/MailInterfaces-2.4.12.flute#MailMessage")
class AcmeMailMessage {

  private final String rfc822Text;

  public AcmeMailMessage(String rfc822Text) {
    this.rfc822Text = rfc822Text;
  }

  @FuteOperation("getMessageId")
  public String getMessageId() {
    return parseHeader("message-id");
  }

  @FuteOperation("getSender")
  public EmailAddress getSender() {
    return new AcmeEmailAddress(parseHeader("from"));
  }

  private String parseHeader(String name) {
    /* ... */
  }
}
</pre>

<h3>Object Identity and Persistence</h3>

<p>We do <em>not</em> make the requirement that resolving the same URI
twice will result in two pointers to the same Thing, or even two
Things that represent the same "distributed object". This is important
in understanding how the Thing Browser can support the REST semantics
of the Web, where an active Web page, loaded using a starting URI and
subsequently manipulated, has state (in its dynamically changing DOM
tree) independent from that of another page, in another browser
window, loaded using the same URI. A Thing Resolver may resolve
<code>http://thing.google.com/</code> to a completely new Thing each
time it is invoked; each resulting Thing would be viewable and would
be a new, independent interactor from which the user could initiate
Google searches.</p>

<p>Taken together, the stipulations that a Thing's URI may change
during its lifetime, and that a URI need not uniquely identify a
Thing, means that we leave questions of [distributed] object identity
completely up to the plugins that implement Thing Resolvers and
Things. The Thing Browser treats a URI as a <em>query</em> for
information, but does not assume it is a globally unique object
identifier.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>(Clink, Flute) is <strong>not</strong> equivalent to (CORBA ORB,
CORBA IDL) or ([D]COM, DCOM IDL). Clink assumes components running in
the same address space, or close enough to make no material
difference. There are no structs -- everything is an interface --
since there is no wire protocol to worry about. There is no need to
<em>addRef</em>, no distributed garbage collection, and no distributed
leases, since we assume the objects are all reachable by a reasonable
garbage collection algorithm. (Clink interfaces to C++ will require
that developers implement lifecycle callbacks, but that's due to the
semantics of the language, and has nothing to do with Clink
itself.)</p>

<p>We choose not to use XPIDL (and, by corollary, XPCOM) since XPIDL
is a C++-like language that is hard to parse. One can imagine a Flute
interface repository or dynamic Facet implementation
generator written in <a
href="/twiki/bin/view/Main/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and based on XML
or JSON (see below) representations of the Flute data. Flute can be
validated and edited by any XML tools. Documentation can be generated
from Flute using simple <a href="/twiki/bin/view/Main/XSS">XSS</a>
stylesheets.</p>

<p>TODO: Decide how much, if at all, to use XML Schema data types for
primitive data types in Flute.</p>

<p>We can use <a href="http://jsonml.org/" target="_top">JsonML</a>
for mapping to JSON, thus reducing the parsing needs on the
client. TODO: Decide how this will be represented, and whether we
should come up with a unified scheme for asking for JSON when we
<code>GET</code> a Flute document by HTTP.</p>
